# Google-girl-Hackathon
#Problem statement:-
As discussed in workshops, manufactured chips may have structural faults at certain places/nodes, which must be tested before being delivered to end users.
The task is to design an algorithm and write its code to identify the input vector required to identify the fault at a given node in a given circuit.
In a case, there would only be a single fault in the design.
The algorithm should be efficient, robust and able to identify faults quickly.

#Required format of input file:-
Make a file named circuit.txt . The code will automatically read the circuit file and will generate the output. The Fault_Node and Fault_Type is predefined here so the code will generate the output corresponding to net_f node and SAO type. The circuit file should be at same location as the code.
